  name: 'YOLOv11-based Real-Time Smoke & Fire Detection',
  description: `
An intelligent system for detecting smoke and fire in real-time using a surveillance camera and a desktop interface. The solution utilizes the YOLOv11 deep learning model, trained on 144,000+ images, and achieves high accuracy even in low-light and noisy environments.

Detection follows a 3-step pipeline:

1. Color Pattern Analysis:  
Initial frame is scanned for potential fire/smoke color patterns like light gray or orange.

2. Color Conversion:  
Detected regions are converted to bright red/orange tones to highlight possible risk zones.

3. YOLOv11 Inference:  
The processed frame is passed to the trained model to confirm detection and return bounding boxes with precise location data.

The system includes live video display, report logging, and multi-platform alerting (Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS).`,
